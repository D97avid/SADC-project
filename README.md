# SADC-project
 The design of the Attitude Dynamics and Control System of a 12 U CubeSat is carried out. The satellite, that is required to point Earth with a pointing error less than 1Â°, has been considered on a LEO orbit, therefore the simulation takes into account the most prominent disturbance torques typical of this environment as well as the performances of the selected ADCS components.
 
 The CubeSat is equipped with the following sensors:
 - gyroscope
 - Sun sensor
 - Earth horizon sensor
 
 The CubeSat is equipped with the following actuators:
 - 12 x Electric thrusters

 The mission is composed by three phases:
 1. Detumbling
 2. Slew manoeuvre
 3. Earth pointing

The project has been performed using MATLAB and Simulink.
